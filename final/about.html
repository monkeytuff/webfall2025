   <h2>Football Rivalry</h2>
   <p>The rivalry dates back to 1892, when a dispute over the ownership of Anfield led to the formation of Liverpool FC. Prior to this, Everton had been the dominant club in the city, having been founded in 1878. The split resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park, just a short distance away, which intensified the competition between the two clubs. It is called the mercyside derby and today, it is one of the biggest in all of England.
